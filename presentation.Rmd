## Car pollution... What to blame?

Everyone can dream about an ideal cars that perfectly match his needs.

## But...

Since the environment needs to be preserved, what should governments and manufacturers limit?  
  
We will split cars in some big groups:  
- **City cars**  
- **Long-distance cars**  
- **Off-road vehicles**  
- **Sport cars**  
  
Let's do some hypothesis with interesting data...

## Correlation between CO2 and liters by 100K
![Interestig correlation because we can almost equiparate the two variables](CO2km.png){height=450px}
```{r pressure}
cor(1/(rethink %>% filter (MPG > 0 & CO2 > 0 & Fuel == "Tier 2 Cert Gasoline"))$MPG, (rethink %>% filter (MPG > 0 & CO2 > 0 & Fuel == "Tier 2 Cert Gasoline"))$CO2)
```
## Weight

- Sports cars: heaviest mass at the bottom  
- Off road vehicles: total weight lowest as possible

## Horsepower

- Sport cars: needed to reach higher speed and better acceleration  

## Cylinders

- Sport cars and long-distance cars: not too little in order to reduce vibration

## Gears and air drag coefficient

![As we can see, the power needed to go faster become higher as the speed increase](cd.png)  
We can also increase the maximum speed by reducing the acceleration adjusting gears ratio.  

>  - Sport cars: maximize the maximum speed  
- City cars: acceleration over maximum speed  
- Off-road cars: maximize acceleration (reduced gears)

## Conclusion

Everyone would decrease emissions, we have to keep in mind different type of cars meets different needs and have different aims.
